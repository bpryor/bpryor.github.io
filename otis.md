# 480/Otis 

When Otis arrived back at the falls after his walkabout yesterday afternoon, we were ecstatic, but unfortunately he still looked weak and skinny and a bit shaky. And lost. He kept getting kicked out of the office and he'd sort of stand off to the side with a vacant look in his eyes. Then he'd go lay down for a bit, eat some grass, then repeat. This happened a few times over the afternoon/evening hours. He had no luck with fishing. The happy reunion started to have a dark cloud over it, at least for me.

As dusk was setting in, Otis returned yet again and didn't have much of a place to go, as the office was still occupied. Finally one bear caught a fish and headed over to the little "island" and Otis followed. As the other bear (I'm terrible with numbers, but I think 907?) ate his catch, Otis stood inches away nose to nose, head down, asking for a piece. I literally burst into sobbing tears. Intellectually I know this is all part of nature and the cycle of life, but it is hard to see any of God's magnificent creatures so humbled. The other bear gave him a small scrap right at the end, and that seemed to bring a touch of light to Otis's eyes.

He stood on the island a bit longer, probably hoping for more scraps. But when the same bear caught another, he ran off into the woods to eat in solitude. That left the J open, and Otis slid right in.

He sat there for a bit but no luck, so he started wandering over to the C. Then the office opened up again and he went back into his favorite corner.

At this point it was somewhere around midnight AK time. The cams had switched to monochrome but thankfully a pair of AWESOME camops volunteers stayed up and kept the BF cam zoomed on Otis. I'm going to guess there were 20ish people still on chat, including one who was logged in from the campgrounds. No one wanted to go to bed until Otis caught a salmon. About 15-20 minutes in, he pounces, and appears to miss. Then he sticks his head back underwater and BOOM, he got one! Ê•â€¢á´¥â€¢Ê”ðŸŽ‰

If message board words had a sound, you could have heard us all all the way in space. This board ERUPTED with cheers and tears of joy. Otis ate his fish and then even licked his paws. As he turned to start fishing again, something had definitely changed in his posture. The wobbly, worn down and lost stance he'd had only minutes earlier was suddenly brought to life. His shoulders were back, his eyes brighter, his fish scanning more intense. It was a very happy moment.

At that point it was so late it was time for most people to go to bed, and the camera zoomed back to it's default position. So we couldn't see Otis anymore, except for the occasional moving shadow and brief glow of eyes. I checked in a few times and around 2:45 a.m. AK time and he was still there, and someone had just joined him (by the shape/glow of ears it might have been Grazer). I'm not sure he has even gone to bed yet.

Anyways, I thought some of you might enjoy the story. I was hoping he'd found success and it sounds like he has. All I want his for him to live his golden years with a full belly :).

> As a side note, is it possible Grazer is Otis's daughter? The ears remind me of each other and she seems to be around a lot when he is. Not that bears know their paternal family, but they may have some sense of familial connection through smell or other senses.
